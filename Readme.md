• What is your process for determining what to test and why?

→ I have analyzed the requirement to identify the test scenarios.

• What methodologies do you use and what is your approach?

→ I have used testng Framework. to

• How would you structure your test suites, or would you use another strategy for test case
management? What is your approach?
→ i should use POM and PageFactory

• What technical documentation would you produce for posterity?

→ javadoc

• How would you expand upon this to make it scalable across more features, services, and/or teams?

→ using POM and PageFactory model we can enhance the project easily

• How would you maintain your automated tests over time? How are automated tests and testcases related?
→ i will use git, docker and jenkins

• How would you report test failures to the team? Would you track any progress over time? How
could you maintain confidence in the data you are providing the team?
→ will create a test report and maintain the logs for the failures

• What challenges did you face when developing your solution? How did you overcome them?

→ while developing the framework architecture we can face following:
    > maintaing the driver for 
    > maintain data factory
    > maintain multi browser testing
    > reporting at one place
    > singleton object
    > mainting the bridge

• Was there anything you couldn't overcome? What prevented you? What would you propose to
unblock yourself?
    > can not automated some testcase as a part of script. to resolve this issue follow microservices or 
      maintain the testcase using tags
